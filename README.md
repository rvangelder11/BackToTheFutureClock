I modified the design of the parts to fit to my printer and added openings to be able to accomodate a flatcable.
I designed a PCB that can be used for all three levels by chosing the correctc onnector.
I connected the 3 PCB's with a floppy disk flatcablew that I have in ample supply from various computers
